### Project Description
This super fun web app lets you dive into a purr-fectly delightful cat-themed adventure! Click anywhere, and poof‚Äîa random cat pic (from a stash of 200+ cars pulled from Unsplash and Pexels) lands right where you clicked, sized randomly between 100px and 300px for that extra charm. Drag those adorable kitties around with your mouse, double-click to summon 1‚Äì3 more from the same crew (like tabby or siamese squads), and watch them scatter randomly across the screen. It‚Äôs an endless cat party‚Äîimages stick around, stay in bounds even if you resize the window, and it‚Äôs all built with snappy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth, playful vibe!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
No cat spawns when clicked randomly on a webpage :(

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So we made a web app that displays cat images when clicked randomly on a webpage :) #happy!

## Technical Details
#### Languages used:

- CSS
- Vanila Javascript

### Implementation

### Project Documentation
For Software:Cat Clicker Party is a whimsical web-based application designed to bring joy with every click. Inspired by the internet‚Äôs favorite animal‚Äîcats‚Äîthis app turns your screen into a playful canvas of paws, fur, and fun interactions.

üéØ Features

* Instant Interaction:
Upon loading, users are greeted with a bold ‚ÄúClick Anywhere‚Äù prompt.

* Random Cat Placement:
Clicking anywhere on the screen spawns a random cat image from a pool of over 200+ optimized images (20‚Äì50 KB each), randomly sized between 100px and 300px.

* Drag & Drop:
Users can click and drag any image around the screen, allowing for creative placement and interaction.

* Double-Click Fun:
Double-clicking on a cat summons 1 to 3 more cats of the same type (e.g., tabby, siamese), randomly placed nearby.

* Persistent Party:
Cats stay on screen even when the window is resized. The layout adjusts so images remain visible and within bound

üöÄ How It Works (Workflow)

Cat is:

- Randomly selected from a predefined pool

- Random size (100‚Äì300px)

* Image can be dragged and repositioned.

* Double-click on a cat ‚ûú 1‚Äì3 cats of similar breed pop up near it.

* Images stay in viewport bounds, even on window resize
