# orange cat - A *Useless* Project


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Maveriks

### Project Description
This super fun web app lets you dive into a purr-fectly delightful cat-themed adventure! Just load it up, and a bold "Click Anywhere" pops up, begging you to get started. Click anywhere, and poof—a random cat pic (from a stash of 200+ low-file-size cuties, think 20kb–50kb, pulled from Unsplash and Pexels) lands right where you clicked, sized randomly between 100px and 300px for that extra charm. Drag those adorable kitties around with your mouse, double-click to summon 1–3 more from the same crew (like tabby or siamese squads), and watch them scatter randomly across the screen. It’s an endless cat party—images stick around, stay in bounds even if you resize the window, and it’s all built with snappy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth, playful vibe!
